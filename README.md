# Simple-Linear-Regression
Practice project on Imple Linear Regression. The dataset used for this project is downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohankayan/years-of-experience-and-salary-dataset)

# Problem Statement
In this project, I used a dataset f two variables, salary (in rupees) and years of experience. The goal of this project is to:
* Find out if there is any relationship between the two variables.
* Fit a line of best fit for the dataset.
* Determine how the dependent variable is changing with changes in the independent variable.

# Libraries used
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Sci-kit learn
* Matplotlib

# Steps followed
* Data preprocessing.
There was no missing data present in the dataset.
* Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, in the ratio 7:3.
* Fitting a simple linear regression model to the training set.
* Prediction of the test and training sets.
* Visualizing the training and testing sets results.

# Results and Conclusions.
From the results, the model was able to attain an R-squared score of 0.9741. This means that 97.41% of variation in salary amounts is explained by the years of experience.
